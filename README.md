# FIVESTIX
An anonymous map game

---

The general concept of this "anonymous" map game is based on the realisation that almost all map games (Stellaris being a notable exception) base themselves off Earth, on real history, and often pride themselves on their ability to simulate real or alternate histories. The "anonymity" of this game comes from the fact that it's not in a different epoch of history, but operates on an entirely different playing field. Procedurally generated (buzzword!) cultures, languages, and starting countries all interact to give the player a *completely new* political experience.
